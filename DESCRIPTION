Description: R-based access to mass-spectrometry (MS) data. While many packages 
  exist to process MS data, many of these make it difficult to 
  access the underlying mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), intensity, and 
  retention time of the files 
  themselves. This package is designed to format MS data in a tidy fashion and 
  allows the user perform the plotting and analysis.
